mTag is a an for mobile devices that aims to make it easy to add objects into metameta ; it aims to be a simple, lightweight program to:

- query items from the metameta ecosystem and add object-specific sub-objects (such as task instances) : TODO

At the moment, mtag is in offline-mode only, engine integration has not been done.
